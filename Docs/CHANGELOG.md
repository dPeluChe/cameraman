# Changelog

All notable changes to Cameraman will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **4K HEVC export preset** (3840x2160, 60fps, 30Mbps) in export options
- **Duplicate project** — deep copy via context menu, auto-opens the clone
- **Export transcript as TXT/SRT/VTT** — full caption export with NSSavePanel
- **Video effects sidebar** — corner radius (0–16px), shadow intensity (0–100%), padding (0–30%) controls
- **Background gradients** — 8 presets (Sunset, Ocean, Forest, Midnight, Lavender, Ember, Arctic, Slate) in new "Gradient" tab
- **Project thumbnails** — auto-generated JPEG from first frame of screen video on project creation; shown in project list

### Fixed
- **Mic audio race condition** — validates AVAudioEngine format before recording; auto-retry with 300ms delay if format invalid (0 Hz / 0 channels)
- **"Publishing changes from within view updates"** — BackgroundControlsView state mutation deferred with Task
- **onChange macOS 13 compatibility** — 12 instances of macOS 14+ API converted to macOS 13 single-parameter syntax
- **SHA256 placeholders** — replaced 8 "placeholder" values with real CryptoKit SHA256 streaming hashes (64KB chunks, constant memory)
- **Hardcoded video dimensions** — screen and camera tracks now use `detectVideoDimensions()` for actual recorded resolution
- **Timer intervals** — export/keystroke polling reduced to 0.25s; recording elapsed display kept at 0.1s for smooth UX
- **ExportViewModel timer leak** — deinit now invalidates progressUpdateTimer if view dismissed during export

### Technical
- EngineKit passes `-strict-concurrency=complete` with zero warnings
- `ProjectStore.sha256(of:)` uses streaming FileHandle (constant memory for 1GB+ files)
- `ProjectStore.generateThumbnail()` uses AVAssetImageGenerator + CGImageDestination (pure CoreGraphics)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Auto-zoom from cursor telemetry** — `DwellDetector` detects cursor pauses (>450ms stationary), `ZoomSuggestionEngine` combines click windows + dwell candidates into unified suggestions. Timeline shows yellow markers for each suggestion; click markers to accept/reject individually. "Apply" creates zoom keyframes and persists zoom config on segments.
- **GIF export options** — when "Animated GIF" preset is selected, ExportView shows GIF-specific controls: frame rate (10/15/24 fps), max size (480/800/1200), loop toggle. Options flow through `GIFExportOptions` to the existing `GIFExportSession` engine.
- New EngineKit files: `DwellDetector.swift`, `ZoomSuggestionEngine.swift`
- `PreviewEngine.setZoomPlan()` public setter for external zoom plan application

### Technical
- `ZoomSuggestionEngine` is a stateless enum with static methods (no actor overhead)
- `ZoomSuggestion.toClickWindow()` unifies coordinate conversion in one place
- Individual suggestion accept/reject via `dismissedSuggestionIds` state set

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-30

### Performance
- **Fix Task leak in CameraEngine/CaptureEngine** — duration timer now stores a cancellable `Task` handle with `!Task.isCancelled` guard; cancelled explicitly on `stopRecording()`
- **Fix AVPlayer observer leak in PreviewEngine** — `stopPeriodicTimeObservation()` now called before nilling player in `unloadProject()`
- **ThumbnailCache LRU eviction** — enforces `maxThumbnailCount` via access-order tracking; evicts oldest entries when limit exceeded
- **Waveform rendering: GeometryReader+Path → Canvas** — renders directly into graphics context, no SwiftUI view tree; uses `ArraySlice` instead of array copy
- **Thumbnail lookup O(n log n) → O(n)** — replaced `sorted()` + `min(by:)` per render with single linear scan
- **Lazy project list loading** — summary cache with file modification date invalidation; skips re-decoding unchanged `project.json` files. `loadProjects()` debounced (500ms)
- **Deferred thumbnail/waveform generation** — initial open generates 15 thumbnails (was 50); remaining thumbnails + waveforms generated at `.utility` priority in background

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Per-track volume sliders** in timeline label area (system audio + mic audio), range 0–3x, with live preview update
- **Area selector highlight** — persistent dashed overlay shows selected capture area; hidden when recording stops or source changes
- **Area selector UX** — double-click to confirm selection; instruction bar adapts text based on state; Escape cancels

### Fixed
- **Mic audio error -50** — `AVAudioFile` settings now match `AVAudioEngine` input node native format (channel count + sample rate), eliminating `ExtAudioFileWrite paramErr`
- **Duplicate editor window** — changed main editor from `WindowGroup` (multi-instance) to `Window` (single-instance) so `openWindow` brings existing window to front
- **Project not auto-selected after recording** — removed async yield before `selectedItem` assignment, eliminating race condition
- **Playback speed change required stop/play** — `playbackRate` now has `didSet` that updates `avPlayer.rate` immediately when playing
- **Area highlight visible in recorded video** — added `sharingType = .none` to `AreaHighlightController` overlay window
- **Area highlight persisting after recording stops** — `hide()` now called at start of `stopAndCleanup()`
- **NSPanel keyboard shortcuts broken** — `KeyablePanel: NSPanel` subclass with `canBecomeKey = true` enables Escape and other shortcuts in area selector
- **Timeline segments not filling available width** — `pixelsPerSecond` now scales dynamically to fill the ScrollView viewport

### Changed
- **Mic audio default volume** boosted from 1.0x to 2.5x to compensate for lower mic input levels vs system audio
- **Timeline label width** expanded from 120 to 160px to accommodate volume sliders
- **Track mute icons** differentiated: speaker for audio tracks, eye for video tracks

### Technical
- `WindowID` enum centralizes window ID constants (eliminates string literals)
- `TimelineTrackKind.isAudioTrack` computed property replaces inline checks in 3 places
- `reapplyAudioMix()` reconstructs state from `lastMuteState` (audio only), avoiding unnecessary `applyVideoMutes` calls on volume changes
- GeometryReader state writes deferred with `Task { @MainActor in }` to avoid "Publishing during view update" warning

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Export view** - Fixed cancel button to properly close modal
- **Video export session** - Added detailed directory and file permission verification
- **Save panel** - Ensured .mp4 extension is added to user-selected files
- **Progress monitoring** - Fixed state updates to prevent UI freezing

### Changed
- **Export workflow** - Files are now exported to temporary location within sandbox, then user saves to desired location via save panel
- **Export logging** - Added comprehensive logging with emojis (🎬) for easier debugging
- **UI behavior** - Export completion now shows "Done" button instead of "Cancel Export"
- **File management** - Improved handling of existing files before export

  - Implemented `saveExportToFile()` with NSSavePanel integration
  - Fixed `projectDirectory` parameter passing from ExportView
  - Added delay before showing save panel for proper UI updates

- **ExportView**:
  - Added "Play Video (Temporary)" button for immediate preview
  - Fixed cancel button behavior to change to "Done" after completion
