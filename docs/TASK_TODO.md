## Bugs & Stability

> Real defects to clear before / during pre-release. None block App Store submission today, but each adds friction.

- [ ] **Pure-static projects don't export** — a project with only image/color cards (no recording and no imported video) can't render: `AVAssetExportSession` (and the GIF frame extractor) need real video samples, so an all-synthetic composition yields "Operation Stopped". Today it's rejected up front with a clear message (`ExportError.noVideoFrames`). To support pure slideshows, synthesize a base video track (render the canvas background/cards to real frames via `AVAssetWriter`, or scale a 1-frame solid clip to the duration) instead of padding the primary with an empty range. ~100 LOC, gate to the no-real-video case. Low impact: any real video clip already makes the project exportable.
- [ ] **PiP camera overlay drag-to-reposition during playback** — historically only worked when paused. Likely resolved by the earlier `fix/pip-drag-playback-and-logs-cleanup` work (`draftCamera` @State pattern) and the throttle change in PR #15. Verify on a fresh build before closing.
- [ ] **Warning: "Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed" on project load** — fires once when opening a project in the editor; benign at runtime, no crash. Three prior fix attempts (`80cfa4e`, `1102beb`, `a08fadf`) were insufficient or regressed. Candidates not yet ruled out: `ProjectEditorViewModel.loadProject`, the toast `Binding(get:set:)` in `ProjectEditorView` line 164, or some mutation in the `.task` chain of `AppNavigation`. Needs runtime instrumentation (breakpoints or `os_log` around the first `objectWillChange.send()`) to locate the real emitter.
- [ ] **`NSHostingView is being laid out reentrantly` / `AttributeGraph: cycle detected` (~150 entries)** — observed once when bumping the PiP throttle to 60Hz; that commit was reverted. Watch for recurrence; if it returns, investigate cyclic dependency between `PreviewPlayerView` (observing `viewModel.avPlayer`), `PiPCanvasEditor` (pushing to `engine.updateProject`), and SwiftUI's view-update graph. Symptom in the affected run: export took 14s vs. the usual 5.4s (~3× slowdown).
- [ ] **Telemetry: count `-10877` errors per session, correlate with `writer.status`** — root cause was H.264 on ultrawide and is fixed, but instrumentation would catch any future writer pre-failure regressions and confirm the cause of the original B1 incident (Messages VFX vs. codec mismatch).
- [ ] **UI debug: `Attempting to update all DD element frames, but bounds W:0 H:0`** — appears once during preview. Probably system Drag & Drop or RealityKit, not our code. Low priority; reproduce with the view debugger if it returns.
- [ ] **Noisy system logs in release builds** — Messages VFX entity remaps, `MLE5Engine disabled`, `ViewBridge to RemoteViewService Terminated`, `AddInstanceForFactory: No factory registered`, `AudioQueueObject Error -4 getting reporterIDs`. None are ours but they drown out useful signal. Audit `LoggingSystem` levels: anything at `info` / `notice` in `capture` / `preview` / `export` that should be `debug`.

## UX Polish

> Small, low-risk improvements. None change product direction.

- [ ] **Latent race in `startNewTake()`** — `ProjectEditorLeftPanel.swift:103-107` assigns `recViewModel.targetProjectId` before posting `.openRecordingWindow`. Works today because the observer is synchronous; if it ever becomes async, the window may read `nil`. Pass `projectId` via `Notification.userInfo` to make the contract explicit.
- [ ] **Count badge on collapsed `ProjectAssetsBar`** — at 38pt height there's no signal of how many takes/segments exist. Add `(\(count))` next to the title when collapsed.
- [ ] **`AssetChip` fixed width truncates long names** — replace `frame(width: 118)` with `minWidth: 100, maxWidth: 180` + `fixedSize(horizontal: false)`.
- [ ] **Export preset picker context** — `.menu` style hides the options; consider `Picker` with per-option icon labels (HEVC, GIF, H.264) to preserve affordance.
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** — `⌘E` open export panel, `⌘⇧E` rerun the last export, `⌘R` open recording window.
- [ ] **Skeletons on `ProjectAssetsBar`** — distinguish "loading" from "empty" while takes are still being read.
- [ ] **Inline filename extension in `ExportView`** — show `.mp4` / `.gif` as a grey inline suffix on the field instead of a separate caption.

---

## UX Roadmap (needs alignment)

> Larger UX changes worth a conversation before implementing.

- [ ] **Recent Exports memory** — remember the last 3–5 destination folders and surface them as quick suggestions (Final Cut / Premiere pattern).
- [ ] **Right inspector tabs** — replace the stacked `ScrollView` of `ConfigGroup`s (Background / PiP / Zoom / Overlays) with tabbed sections to reduce scroll depth.
- [ ] **Layout preset hover preview** — overlay the chosen layout on the current frame inside the picker on hover.
- [ ] **Configurable asset bar position** (top / left / right) in Settings → Layout.
- [ ] **Empty state for a newly opened editor** — inline onboarding ("Drag a take from the bar above to start editing") with an animated arrow pointing at the empty timeline.
- [ ] **Visible zoom curve in timeline** — replace flat markers with a height-proportional mini graph so zoom intensity is readable.

## Tester Feedback — 0.6.3 beta round (Diego/Jackie)

> Raised 2026-06-10 after the first public-link beta. Analysis done (see session notes); ordered by agreed priority.

- [x] **Merge projects** — shipped (see `TASK_COMPLETED/2606.md`).
- [x] **Export / Import project bundle** — shipped in the 0.6.4 round (see above).
- [x] **Import video (with audio) into timeline** — shipped, including chips with drag/snap/trim/split, PiP positioning, row colors/reorder, and empty projects (see `TASK_COMPLETED/2606.md`).

---

## Tester Feedback — 0.6.4 round (next branch)

> Raised 2026-06-10 during the import/merge validation run.

- [x] **Export presets: bitrate control + estimated file size** — shipped: session preset now honors the codec (HEVC presets really export HEVC), `fileLengthLimit` targets the preset bitrate (it was decorative — hence the 951MB export), quality picker (Smaller/Standard/Higher) scales it, and the size estimate uses the same formula.
- [x] **Split → drag UX on video chips** — shipped: trim handles only exist (and are visibly drawn) on the SELECTED chip; unselected chips always move on drag.
- [x] **Export/Import project bundle** — shipped: `.cameramanproject` folder bundles (essentials only), context-menu Export Bundle… + '+' menu Import Project… with fresh project id.

## Editor Features (planned)

> Next batch of editor work. Depends on a stable export pipeline and `TimelineView`.

- [ ] **Mixed-resolution timelines — residual edge** — screen and camera-PiP frames now refit per-frame, and mixed-res projects always route through the compositor (preview + export). Remaining: camera refit needs `cameraRect` in the instruction (the single-instruction overlay paths pass nil), and zoom focus mapping uses the first clip's transform — both only matter if a merged section with a different-resolution camera also uses those paths.
- [ ] **Preview visibility toggles (Overlays/Layout/Captions)** — removed from the bar under the preview because they were never wired (local @State, no effect on render). Implementing them for real means gating overlay/layout/caption rendering in the preview pipeline per toggle.
- [ ] **Auto-zoom tuning** — hidden behind `FeatureFlags.autoZoom` (default off): suggestion timing/intensity confused testers; auto-apply-on-open removed. Tune dwell thresholds, zoom-out blending and intensity before re-enabling by default.

- [ ] **Zoom animation tuning** — hold duration, in/out velocity, smoother transitions between adjacent zoom points. The zoom-out between two points currently feels abrupt; evaluate a blend or crossfade.
- [ ] **Overlay polish**:
    - **Timing**: overlays appear in the wrong range during preview — debug the `currentTime >= overlay.start && currentTime <= overlay.end` filter in `MaskedVideoCompositor`.
    - **Edits not reflected**: position / scale / rotation changes from the popover don't show in preview. Verify `rebuildVideoComposition` propagates updated overlays and the overlay layer cache invalidates on property change.
    - **Visual placement canvas**: the 9-position presets are limited. Implement a mini canvas (like the PiP editor) where the user drags the overlay over a thumbnail of the frame.
    - **Stacking in timeline**: multiple overlays collapse onto a single row; needs visual stacking or per-overlay rows.
    - **Render quality**: arrow / rect sizes and positions don't match the configured values.
    - What works today: timeline track, drag to move, popover controls, basic shape rendering in compositor and export.
- [ ] **Visible captions in preview** (improve current rendering).
- [ ] **Mic noise gate / echo cancellation** — filter speaker bleed captured by the mic, voice-activity detection to suppress silence. Note: `attackCoef` was removed from `AudioProcessing.swift` (unused warning); the gate currently jumps straight to 1.0 with no attack smoothing. If a full noise gate ships, restore the original coefficient.

---

## Engine Work (planned)

> Replacing stubs and skeleton implementations with real ones.

- [ ] **Real Whisper.cpp integration** — `TranscriptionEngine` returns simulated text today. Integrate `whisper.cpp` (or `SwiftWhisper`) for true offline transcription. Depends on a consolidated `JobQueue`.
- [ ] **Live recording preview** — the source selector currently shows static captures. Stream a lightweight ScreenCaptureKit feed during selection. Depends on the in-flight `EngineContext` DI refactor.

---

## Overlay System — Phase 2

> Deferred from the `refactor/overlays-unified-system` branch.

- [ ] **`Style` bag-of-optionals → `OverlayContent` enum with associated values** — replace `Style { stroke, font?, size?, color?, bg?, text?, imagePath?, ... }` with a discriminated enum (`shape`, `text`, `image`, `video`). Requires a custom `Codable` with back-compat decoding for existing projects. Ties into adding video as an overlay type below.
- [ ] **Reusable per-project asset library** — `imagePath` is absolute today and breaks when the user moves the source. On drop, copy into the project's `assets/` and store a relative path. UI: a sidebar grid of project assets, drag onto the timeline / preview to create an overlay.
- [ ] **Animated GIF in export (not just first frame)** — `ExportOverlayRenderer.swift` adds a single-frame `CALayer.contents`. Switch to `CAKeyframeAnimation` over `.contents` with each frame as a keyframe and timing matching the source GIF.
- [ ] **Drag overlay clip edges in timeline to trim** — currently the overlay clip only supports horizontal move. Mirror the trim pattern from `TimelineView+DragDrop` for edge drag → start / end change.
- [ ] **Video overlay** (additional `AVMutableComposition` track) — enables B-roll / picture-in-picture from another video. Refactor `MaskedVideoCompositor` to read `request.sourceFrame(byTrackID:)` from the overlay track and composite. Audio mix needs updating.
- [ ] **Granular subscription in `OverlayPopover`** (perf, low priority) — the popover observes the whole `editor` and re-renders on every project mutation (autosave / undo). Real cost is low (~1Hz max, popover visible only during edit) and the work was scoped out in the unified-overlay session. If it becomes perceptible with many overlays, model as `OverlayPopoverModel: ObservableObject` with `editor.$project.map { ...overlay-by-id... }.removeDuplicates()`.

---

## Engine — Polish & Experimental

> Larger backend items; many are speculative or post-v1.

- [ ] **Motion blur on zoom transitions** — blur proportional to camera movement during zoom in/out via `CIMotionBlur` or a Metal shader. Applied in `MaskedVideoCompositor` / `PreviewComposition`.
- [ ] **Hide desktop icons during recording** — toggle in `RecordingControlView`. On start: `defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false && killall Finder`. On stop: restore. Save the prior value in case the user had them hidden already. Note: Finder restart causes a brief visual flash.
- [ ] **Interactive crop with aspect-ratio presets** (16:9 / 9:16 / 4:3 / 1:1 / 21:9) — drag + numeric inputs + ratio lock. Applied to the source video before layout.
- [ ] **Reorder segments in timeline** (v1.1).
- [ ] **Hover thumbnails on preview scrubber**.
- [ ] **Distribution permissions and entitlements review** before public launch.
- [ ] **Auto-generate proxies on project creation**.
- [ ] **Regenerate proxies when sync offsets change**.
- [ ] **Refactor `ZoomSectionController` + `ZoomPlanGenerator`** — their tests are the largest in the suite (49KB / 48KB), which usually signals the code under test is overdue for simplification.
- [ ] **Evaluate `LoggingSystem`: actor → `nonisolated` with lock** — `os_log` is thread-safe by design; the actor wrapper adds `await` friction in every call site. Only worth doing if the `await` causes real friction.
- [ ] **Cloud provider for generated assets** (background art, voiceover, etc.).
- [ ] **Frame-by-frame stylization** (experimental).
- [ ] **Auto-cuts on silence** (PRD Phase 5).
- [ ] **Chapters / titles from transcript** (PRD Phase 5).

## Performance (deferred)

> Items with a real cost but acceptable defaults today.

- [ ] **Long-duration validation** — never tested with videos > 1 hour. Stress test the writer, mic queue, telemetry parser, and preview composition end-to-end at that length.
- [ ] **`TimelineView` body memoization** — `TimelineTrackBuilder.tracks(for:)` and `computeOverlayRows(...)` run on every body invalidation. During playback `currentTime` ticks constantly and triggers redundant recomputes. Requires extracting a sub-view or a derived `@StateObject`.
- [ ] **`ThumbnailCache` LRU O(N) → O(log N) or O(1)** — `thumbnailAccessOrder.removeAll { $0 == key }` is O(N) per insert; with `maxThumbnailCount = 500` each miss is 500 comparisons. Needs `swift-collections` `OrderedDictionary` or a manual hash + linked list.
- [ ] **`MaskedVideoCompositor` dynamic camera property** — proper fix for the PiP drag rebuild path. Updates would skip the `AVMutableVideoComposition` rebuild entirely. Touches every consumer of the custom compositor. The throttle bump in PR #15 is the interim mitigation.
- [ ] **`RecordingSession` snapshot refactor** — the interim `@unchecked Sendable` from PR #15 is fine for now. Long-term, replace with a `Sendable` `SessionState` snapshot consultable on demand (no shared mutable state crossing actor isolation).

---

## Distribution / Gatekeeper

- [ ] **Ad-hoc signing in `build-dmg.sh`** — `codesign --force --deep --sign - CameramanApp.app` before packaging. Does not bypass Gatekeeper on Tahoe but stabilizes the internal signature and avoids errors with embedded frameworks. Tester feedback recorded in `TASK_COMPLETED/2605.md`.
- [ ] **Developer ID + notarization** — the only real fix for the Gatekeeper warning on macOS Tahoe. Requires the Apple Developer Program subscription, the `Developer ID Application` certificate, and a `xcrun notarytool submit` + `stapler staple` pipeline.

---

## Tooling — Claude Code Skills

- [ ] **Create a `cameraman-engine` skill via `/skill-creator`** — gap identified during the skills baseline review: no public skill covers AVFoundation / ScreenCaptureKit / `AVMutableComposition` / the keyframed zoom pipeline. Package internal conventions: `CompositionBuilder`, `MaskedVideoCompositor`, `AudioMixBuilder`, the `DwellDetector → ZoomSuggestionEngine → ZoomPlanGenerator → PreviewRenderer` pipeline, the engine/UI actor split, the 400–500 LOC and zero-warnings rules. Validate against a real task (refactor of `ZoomSectionController` or a new overlay type). Decide whether to publish it or keep it under `.claude/skills/`.

---

## Compiler / SDK limitations (waiting on Apple)

- [ ] **2 irreducible warnings in `MaskedVideoCompositor`** — `sourcePixelBufferAttributes` and `requiredPixelBufferAttributesForRenderContext` don't accept the `@Sendable` getter that `AVVideoCompositing` requires via `NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE`. Standard workarounds all fail: `@preconcurrency import`, `@preconcurrency` on conformance, `nonisolated` computed property with `static let`, `[String: any Sendable]`. Waiting on an SDK fix from Apple; documented inline in the file.
